# NOVIA

NOVIA: A Framework for Discovering Non-Conventional Inline Accelerators, is an LLVM-based toolset that allows for automatic recognition, instantiation and code instrumentations of inline accelerators. NOVIA uses unified bitcode files to analyze a workload and propose inline accelerators to the architect.

The current NOVIA release does not provide the hardware support [NOVIA Functional Unit (NFU)] or the compiler support (clang patch) to compile NFU instructions to RISC-V. Future commits will provide those.

# Notes on Repo Status

NOVIA 1.5 contains a partial status update on key elements of NOVIA. Mainly includes patches to llvm-13.0, the RISC-V Ariane core as well as gcc-binutils to enable NOVIA/NFU instructions to be lowered to binary and be executed in RISC-V Ariane cores.

novia.conf file is also added that handles several configuration aspects of the tool.

The contents of diff patches can be applied to their respective repos:
* ariane.patch: Changes to RISC-V Ariane core, instantiantes de NFU, that allows to easily swap inline accelerators, contains few example accelerators
* binutils.path: Changes to gcc-binutils
* llvm.patch: This  is a partial patch and it is not completed. The changes allow llvm to generate NFU instructions and binaries directly from NOVIA analysis when NOVIA_MODE=0

Check scripts/install.sh for how to apply the patches

## Native
This requires the dependencies mentioned in the previous section, and will install the automated dependencies.

`./scripts/install.sh`

## Docker Install
`docker build . -t novia:v2`

## Docker Run
`docker run -it novia:v2 /bin/bash`

# Getting Started
NOVIA comes with several automated examples in the subdirectory fusion/examples. The examples contain the base source code, a makefile that generates the input bitcode for novia and a configuration file needed for novia to compile bitcode (mainly the libraries and linking flags needed).

0. `source env.sh`
1. `cd fusion/examples/incremental`
2. `make`
3. `novia incremental.bc`

Type `novia -h` for additional help.

# Usage Instructions
0. `source env.sh` before usage.
1. Generate a unified LLVM IR bitcode file of the binary to analyze:
   1. Use clang and -emit-llvm flag to generate bitcode files 
   2. Use llvm-link to merge several bitcode fites into a unified bitcode file
2. Apply methodology:
   1. Generate a configuration file with two variables $EXECARGS (Execution arguments that will be used when profiling the workload) $LDFLAGS (Linking flags and libraries needed to compile the workload). **You can find examples of that in the example directory (e.g., fusion/examples/incremental/conf.sh)**
   2. Run the novia tool ( `novia *bitcode_file*` ) [`source env.sh` or use the full path to the tool in fusion/bin]
   3. The tool will generate a **novia** folder containing the intermediatte bitcode files of the analysis

## Further Operation Instructions
The tool is made so that it reuses as much generated data as possible. This means that once we run the tool and the **novia** folder is generated, reruning the tool won't update the bitcode files or the analysis, in case we want to change the configuration. To force the tool to regenerate new files or data for analysis we must first remove the files we want to regenerate from the **novia** folder.

By default, on the first run, the tool will generate either instrumentation or inline functions for all the detected viable inline accelerators. This list of implemented accelerators will be dumped in **nfu.txt**. We can remove split candidates from **nfu.txt** and rerun the tool (remember to delete the final bitcode file in novia/output/*_novia.bc) to generate the new bitcode file without the removed inline accelerators.

# Directory Structure

- fusion: novia related scripts and files
   - fusion/examples: synthetically crafted examples
   - fusion/analysis/scripts: data treatment scripts
   - fusion/src: source code
   - fusion/bin: link to novia executable script
- scripts: installation scripts

# Generated Files

When the novia automated analysis script is executed on a bitcode file, the following directories and files will be generated in the bitcode's directory:

- novia folder:
  - **copy of original analyzed bitcode file**
  - **executable binary of instrumented bitcode file**
  - novia/output: annotated bitcode and configuration file for the SoC/Accelerator integration
  - novia/bitcode: folder with intermediate optimized bitcode files
  - novia/data: raw data files for analysis and output summaries:
    - **bblist.txt**: List of basic blocks analyzed by the tool
    - **histogram.txt**: Profiling data per basic block:
      - data fields-[cycle count,total application cycle count,iterations]
    - **weights.txt**: Derived data analysis from histogram.txt:
      - data fields-[time % of bitcode,time % of entire application,iterations] 
    - **orig.csv**/**merge.csv**/**split.csv**: Data metrics for different novia stages
    - **io_overhead.csv**: Metrics refering to input and output variables for the accelerators
    - **stats.csv**: Other metrics
    - **source.log**: Location in source code of basic blocks and accelerators
    - **nfu.txt**: List of inline accelerators to be implemented in the NFU (All by default)
  - novia/imgs: DFGs of the analyzed basic blocks, merged ISs and final accelerator candidates in .png format
  - novia/bin: Binaries compiled from bitcode files

# Configuration files

NOVIA has several starter and intermediate scripts that can be configured to tailor the analysis. Although the tool is implemented so only the frontend `novia` script is necessary to operate the tool, certain options and default values can be configured to adjust NOVIA operation. We provide a brief description of each of those scripts. The most important one being `novia.conf` which defines the basic configuration.

- novia.conf: **Defines the configuration that NOVIA will use. Options available are documented in the file**
- fusion/analysis/scripts/novia.sh: Main novia script.
- fusion/analysis/scripts/analysis.sh: Executes the pre-merge and split process.
- fusion/analysis/scripts/merge.sh: Executes the merge and split process.
- fusion/analysis/scripts/reuse.sh:
- fusion/analysis/scripts/preanalysis.py:
- fusion/analysis/scripts/postanalysis.py:
