\section{The CRUCIBLE framework}

CRUCIBLE provides an efficient way for finding  

The framework has two phases. The first phase is the analysis phase, where code optimizations
and preparation takes place to ease the task of finding acceleratable candidates. Additionally, 
a profiling step is also performed to identify the most interesting candidates. The second phase
is the merge process itself, when the framework runs through the provided candidates and identifies
the most efficient accelerators.
