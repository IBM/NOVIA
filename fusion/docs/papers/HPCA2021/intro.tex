\section{Introdution}

New and novel workloads require unprecedented performance from the systems in which 
they execute. Current trends focus on providing the needed performance through 
a tailored and specific computer architecture in form of accelerators that dramatically increases
the performance of workloads for which it has been design.

However, specialization of the architecture has several drawbacks. First, new
designs are costly since they require full teams of engineers identifying the computation
that needs acceleration, designing the system and finally validating the desgin. Moreover, 
the design of such accelerators is tailored to it's function, hence funelling funds and transistors to
a specific unit function rather than to a more general approach which could provide performance
to all types of workloads
